public class temp {
	create ajava console based program to manage employee tasks within an organization. each task should have:
		-task Id(auto-generated)
		-Employee name
		-Task title
		-Task description
		-task status (Enum: COMPLETED, IN_PROGRESS, PENDING)
		-Assigned date(use java.util.Date)
	
	program should provide the following functionalities
		1. Add a new task record (store task details in a file)
		2. display all task assigned to a specific employee
		3. display task by status(COMPLETED/ IN_PROGRESS/ PENDING)
		4. display count of completed task per employee.
		5. list all tasks sorted by assigned date(read from file)
		6. exit
		
	note: 
		use ArrayList<Task> to store task records in memory.
		save and read from a file named "tasks.txt" to persist data.
		Implement custome exceptions for:
			-EmptyFieldException- throws when a required field(Employee name, task title or discription) is Empty.
			-duplicateTaskException- thrown when the same task (same employee + task title) already exists.
		handle file I/O exception gracefully.
		use simple loops, conditionals, and basic Collections.
		follow clean coding conventions
